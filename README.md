# PlayerCount
Allows you to create a slapper which shows how many players are in a world!
You need slapper in order to make this plugin work

usage:
create a slapper entity with the name "count (world_name)" and thats it, for example we want to know the count of players of the world "PVP"
then we have to "/slapper spawn human count PVP"
Enjoy!
